# Kaggle WSDM Cup - Multilingual Chatbot Arena

This project aims to predict which chatbot response users will prefer in head-to-head battles between large language models.

In this repository, you will find basic dataset analysis, followed by steps for feature engineering, problem modeling, and model selection and training.

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Analysis**: Initial exploration and understanding of the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and processing features to improve model performance.
3. **Modeling**: Building models to predict user preferences.
4. **Model Selection & Training**: Testing various models and training the best one.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the data exploration script (`language_bias_and_text_length.py`) to get insights from the dataset
4. Proceed with feature engineering and modeling in the respective scripts

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and experimentation.
- `src/`: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and utilities.
